EVTNAME1;An Imperial Millennium;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1;Thomas Wareham, a renowned British Historian, has recently published his Magnum Opus after almost 40 years of work with a set of nine books titled "An Imperial Millennium: The History of Britain I-IX". Within months these works have become a focal point for our intellectual community with them being hailed as the most complete and detailed historical record ever written. "An Imperial Millennium" features nine volumes in total with a total page count just over twenty seven thousand and each volume boasting a word count of nearly two million. A few critics claim that Wareham attributes too much of Britain's success to the Windsor Dynasty, and in response Thomas Wareham has made the following statement: “For a millennium now, the House of Windsor has ruled these Isles. It is the sovereigns that the Royal Family have produced that have led Britain to glory, and shall be these sovereigns that keep our Isles united and strong. Should the Windsors' enlightened reign fade away, I fear that the light of civilisation may very well follow.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME2;The Unbroken Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2;Russian playwright, Feodor Kharkov, has just finished a tour of all Russia with his latest epic The Unbroken Dynasty telling the tale of the Fonix dynasty and its history over 16 parts with a complete orchestral backup. The first act opens 1000 years ago in the year 876 A.D. with a young King Harald's conquest of Novgorod, his subsequent establishment of the Fonix dynasty, followed by his learning and integration into the Russian way of life. The first act ends with King Harald's peaceful death and funeral at the age of 67 with a dramatic depiction of the Fonix dynasty's red Phoenix rising up from the ashes of the dead King's funeral pyre. Subsequent acts then show a dramaticized history of each Novgorodian King with the 9th act depicting the reign of King Magnus II and his founding of the Tsardom of Russia. The final act depicts the reign of Tsar Alexander VI leading his armies against Hispanic forces during the Garcian Wars. The play finally ends once the victorious Tsar returns to St. Petersburg and declares the reformation of the Tsardom of Russia into the current Empire of All Russia. Feodor Kharkovs The Unbroken Dynasty has become a smash hit within Russia having been performed everywhere from the Far East to the Baltic coast and to everyone from the lowest farmer to even our Emperor himself. The play is set to become Feodor Kharkovs greatest work yet, cementing his name as one of Russia's greatest playwrights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT2OPTA;A marvellous play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4;Steel Statists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4;The new fascist doctrine has inspired a fringe group of nationalists who think the traditional "Iron Handed" approach is no longer strong enough to keep Russia's enemies at bay. Instead they propose that the state should be like steel. Unbending, unwavering, unrelenting, unapolagetic and unflinching. While small, this group is stirring up trouble nationwide and weakening support for our current government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT4OPTA;They sure like their "un" words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44301;Luis Real and the 1st Mestizo Rebellion;x
EVTDESC44301;The Mestizo people were a group of small communities of Hispanian-Indian blood in the Manitoba region who had hopes of self-government. However, these dreams were shattered when the Hudson's Bay land, which they were a part of, were given to Canada without their consent. In protest the Mestizo people, led by Luis Real, revolted. Luis Real was a highly religious man, who had studied for the clergy in his earlier life. He fought for the Mestizo people and became a hero in the eyes of Manitobans. Luis bargained with the Canadian government for Manitoba's entry into Confederation. Canadian delegates guaranteed the rights of the people would be respected. Thus, Manitoba, the postage-stamp province, was born.;x

EVTOPTB44301;Ignore the Mestizo demands;x
EVTDESC44302;Peaceful relations with the Mestizo, it seems, is not possible. After countless concessions on behalf of the Canadian government, none of it appears to have been enough to sate their unquenchable thirst for subverting the progress of our Dominion. However, upon making our new stance clear to Luis Real and his half-caste clique, they have decided to completely rebel against our authority, taking up arms in open revolt. They have adopted what they call the "Revolutionary Bill of Rights", and declared themselves a nation independent from Canada.;x
