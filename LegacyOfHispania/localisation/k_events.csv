EVTNAME1;An Imperial Milenium;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1;Thomas Wareham, a renowned British Historian, has recently published his Magnum Opus after almost 40 years of work with a set of nine books titled "An Imperial Milenium: The History of Britain I-IX". Within months these works have become a focal point for our intellectual community with them being hailed as the most complete and detailed historical record ever written. "An Imperial Milenium" features nine volumes in total with a total page count just over twenty seven thousand and each volume boasting a word count of nearly two million. A few critics claim that Wareham attributes too much of Britain's success to the Windsor Dynasty, in response Thomas Wareham has made the following statement “For a milenia the House of Windsor has ruled these isles and led us unto becoming a shining beacon of civilisation. Should the Windsors enlightened reign fade away, I fear that the light of civilisation may very well follow.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME2;The Unbroken Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2;Russian playwright, Feodor Kharkov, has just finished a tour of all Russia with his latest epic The Unbroken Dynasty telling the tale of the Fonix dynasty and its history over 16 parts with a complete orchestral backup. The first act opens 1000 years ago in the year 876ad with a young King Haralds conquest of Novgorod, his subsequent establishment of the Fonix dynasty, followed by his learning and integration into the Russian way of life. The first act ends with King Harald's peaceful death and funeral at the age of 67 with a dramatic depiction of the Fonix dynasty's red Phoenix rising up from the ashes of the dead Kings funeral pyre. Subsequent acts then show a dramaticized history of each Novgorodian King with the 9th act depicting the reign of King Magnus II and his founding of the Tsardom of Russia. The final act depicts the reign of Tsar Alexander VI leading his armies against the Spanish during the Garcian Wars. The play finally ends once the victorious Tsar returns to St. Petersburg and declares the reformation of the Tsardom of Russia into the current Empire of All Russia. Feodor Kharkovs The Unbroken Dynasty has become a smash hit within Russia having been performed everywhere from the Far East to the Baltic coast and to everyone from the lowest farmer to even our Emperor himself. The play is set to become Feodor Kharkovs greatest work yet, cementing his name as Russias greatest playwright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME4;Steel Statists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4;The new fascist doctrine has inspired a fringe group of nationalists who think the traditional "Iron Handed" approach is no longer strong enough to keep Russia's enemies at bay. Instead they propose that the state should be like steel. Unbending, unwavering, unrelenting, unapolagetic and unflinching. While small, this group is stirring up trouble nationwide and weakening support for our current government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT4OPTA;They sure like their "un" words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
