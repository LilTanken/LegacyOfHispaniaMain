liberate_south_baltic_desc;At the end of the Garcian Wars The Russian Empire made a case for establishing an independent duchy along the south coast of the Baltic, stretching from south of the Memel to Kiel. Hoping to liberate the large Orthodox minority, which had been so brutally oppressed by the Catholic Polabian administration, the Russian diplomats were firmly rejected and largely ignored by the leading British diplomats meaning the plan never came to fruition. Now that Russia is once again at war with Polabia we are free to take a more forceful approach to the liberation of our Orthodox brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
