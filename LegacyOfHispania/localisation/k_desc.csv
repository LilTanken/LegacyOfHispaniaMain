liberate_south_baltic_title;The South Baltic Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
liberate_south_baltic_desc;At the end of the Garcian Wars The Russian Empire made a case for establishing an independent duchy along the south coast of the Baltic, stretching from south of the Memel to Kiel. Hoping to liberate the large Orthodox minority, which had been so brutally oppressed by the Catholic Polabian administration, the Russian diplomats were firmly rejected and largely ignored by the leading British diplomats meaning the plan never came to fruition. Now that Russia is once again at war with Polabia we are free to take a more forceful approach to the liberation of our Orthodox brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rus_southern_expansion1_title;The Caucasus Edict;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rus_southern_expansion1_desc;Our Southern border, in the Caucasus, has always given cartographers, governors and even Tsars much grief. The region is teeming with Tartars, Greeks, Circasians, Georgians, Perso-Mashriqians and Armenians with an equal number of differing religions that help divide the region. It is left to us then to simplify and optimise the governance of these lands. Ridding the region of the rotting patchwork structure that is the Greek city states and would-be Persian conquerors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rus_southern_expansion2_title;The Second Caucasus Edict;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rus_southern_expansion2_desc;The First Caucasus edit, while successful, didn’t go nearly far enough. The nearby Greeks and Persians still harass our governors and there’s some evidence to suggest that foreign parties are supporting Anti-Russian uprisings in the region. We must go forth and secure the Caucasus in its entirety to ensure that its peoples and resources are safe and secure with Mother Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
